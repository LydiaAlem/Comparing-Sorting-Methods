# Comparing Sorting Method's 

    Sorting methods used:
    -> Java's built-in from --> java.util.Arrays;
    -> Bubble Sorting
    -> Insertion Sorting
    -> Quick Sorting
    -> Heap Sorting
    
      Output: 
      ---------------------------------------------
      Java's built-in sort took 4965500 nanoseconds.
      Bubble sort took 42621125 nanoseconds.
      Insertion sort took 271750 nanoseconds.
      Quick sort took 2742250 nanoseconds.
      
    
    
     Conclusion: Insertion Sort and QuickSort typically fall in range of x < 1000 of eachother, 
     while bubble-sort takes the most amount of time, typically being over five times as longer 
     than insertion and quick sorting!
